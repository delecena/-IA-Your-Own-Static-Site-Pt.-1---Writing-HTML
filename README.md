# -IA-Your-Own-Static-Site-Pt.-1---Writing-HTML
This project establishes a clean, accessible document hierarchy for "Kape Pa More." To ensure optimal SEO and A11y, I am implementing a strictly semantic HTML5 structure, replacing generic div tags with meaningful elements like <main>, <article>, and <section>.

The site architecture utilizes relative linking between four core pages: index.html, about.html, products.html, and branches.html. All visual assets are organized within an assets/images/ directory to maintain a logical root structure. This approach ensures screen-reader compatibility and a clear content flow, providing a robust functional skeleton before any CSS styling begins.
